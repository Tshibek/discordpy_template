# Discord Py Bot Template
Discord.py is a library that allows you to make discord bots with python. This repo is a template for the bot.

# About The Bot
Example bot with django-ORM

# Setup
First of all you need to have the latest version of python (3.8) once you have that there is two ways to setup: <br />
1) You can do it by manualy, I listed all libraries that is needed in requirements.txt you can do "pip install -r requirements.txt".  <br />
Now you can run the bot.py file (Open a command prompt in the bot file and than run "python Bot.py") to start the bot. <br />

# Contributing The Project
You can always pull request to this repo, if you report or fix a bug or if you add more commands to the template I'll be happy implement them. 
I just rebuild https://github.com/xegepa/Discord-Py-Bot-Template and add some extras
